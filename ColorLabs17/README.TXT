Try 1: There's only two colors showing which is dark red and light red, my dad told me to try to do contrasting colors instead.
Try 2: I did purple and white, which were contrasting, I asked my friend how it was and she said for me to do different colors not from the same color tone instead
Try 3: listened to both and did a light blue, dark purple, dark blue and yellow color palette, my sister said that it looks weird and I should choose a darker color to match with a lighter color but switch the blue to a darker one
Try 4: I changed the colors to dark purple and yellow because those were contrasting colors and my mother said that this is a very good choice and I should keep it
